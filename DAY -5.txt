Task- 5

Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark
Tools: Wireshark

1. Installed Wireshark

2. Started capturing packets on active interface WiFi

3. To generate traffic, I have browsed some websites in my web browser Google Chrome

4. After about a minute, I stopped the packet capture using the stop button in wireshark. About 15k packets have been capturen in about a minute.

5. There is a filter option in wireshark which can be used to filter traffic, so I have used that to filter traffic based on various protocols such as DNS, TCP, HTTP etc..,

6. I have identified different protocols in the capture which are: DNS, HTTP, TCP, UDP, TLSv1.2, QUIC, ICMPv6, ARP

7. I have also saved the .pcap file which I will attack in GitHub

8. So by this task, I have understood how to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark and also have found the different network protocols used in the my web browser.
